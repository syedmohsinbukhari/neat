# NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)
Implementation of NEAT in Python3.

## Based on
Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen.


`"NEAT is a powerful method for artificially evolving neuralnetworks."` It both optimizes and complexifies solutions simultaneously
